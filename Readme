# MinecraftStatStream

MinecraftStatStream is a real-time stats tracking and visualization system for Minecraft servers. It fetches player statistics from a Minecraft server, stores them in Redis, and serves the stats through a WebSocket API to a web-based dashboard. The dashboard displays the stats and updates them in real-time as they change on the Minecraft server.

## Features

- Real-time tracking and visualization of Minecraft player stats
- Stats caching using Redis for improved performance
- WebSocket API for low-latency updates
- Easy deployment using Docker and Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/download) (v6.2 or later)
- A Minecraft server with RCON enabled

### Installation
